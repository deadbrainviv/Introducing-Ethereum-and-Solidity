## backup
* See this well-worded guide from Myetherwallet.org, help point 2a: https://www.myetherwallet.com/#help

## restore
If you backed up your entire keystore folder, pull out the text document inside beginning with name "UTC...." If you don't have the text file, only your private key, paste your private key into a text file and save it with any name. In either case: Drop this file it into the Keystore folder in your Mist wallet account data directory. You can find this directory by selecting the Backup... option in the Mist File menu. A window will open showing your keystore folder.

## help
* Go-ethereum aka Geth (https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum) talks about the client we’ll use in this book, geth, as well as other stuff written in Go.
* Cpp-ethereum aka Eth (https://gitter.im/ethereum/cpp-ethereum) lets you get help with eth (and tools related to the C++ implementation).
* Web3.js (https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) is about web3.js, Ethereum JavaScript API library Solidity will be useful for this book, which focuses on the Solidity contract-oriented programming language.
* Serpent (https://gitter.im/ethereum/serpent) although largely being left behind in favor of Solidity, the Serpent language for contract development (based on Python) can be discussed here.
* Mist (https://gitter.im/ethereum/mist) holds discussions about the GUI dapp browser and official wallet app we discussed in this Chapter.
* Light-client (https://gitter.im/ethereum/light-client) hosts discussions about light clients and the LES protocol.
* Research (https://gitter.im/ethereum/research) is where you can talk about Ethereum research. governance (https://gitter.im/ethereum/governance) is for talking about about dev team governance.
* Whisper (https://gitter.im/ethereum/whisper) is for discussions about anonymous datagram publishing.
* Swarm (https://gitter.im/ethereum/swarm) is for discussion of Ethereum’s decentralised content storage and distribution network, which on the roadmap is nicknamed Swarm.
* EIPs (https://gitter.im/ethereum/EIPs) is for discussion of Ethereum Improvement Proposals. ethereumjs-lib (https://gitter.im/ethereum/ethereumjs-lib) is for a JavaScript library of core Ethereum functions.
* Devp2p (https://gitter.im/ethereum/devp2p) is for the DEV p2p network protocol & framework.

## ecosystem
* b9 Lab Blockchain Education (https://www.b9lab.com/): Ethereum developer certification course 
* Ether.camp (http://ether.camp): This group built the popular EthereumJ client and is also building an integrated developer environment that is entirely web-based called “Ethereum Studio.”
* ConsenSys (https://consensys.net): ConsenSys bills itself as a “venture studio” which takes part in large-scale consulting projects, as well as funding community development activities and open source building tools and frameworks.
* Deloitte US (http://deloitte.com): Deloitte is a global consultancy specializing in financial audits, risk management, and financial advisory. They have partnered with ConsenSys to build a “digital bank” entirely on the Ethereum network.
* Monax.io (formerly Eris Industries): Monax has forked the EVM and created tools and libraries for companies building permissioned blockchains. This will become an enormous development field--private corporate chains, optimized for certain use-cases--which we will return to in Chapter 9.
* Linux Foundation + Hyperledger (http://hyperledger.org): The Hyperledger project is a collaborative effort growing out of the Linux Foundation and comprising members like IBM, Intel, Digital Asset, JPMorgan, Hitachi, and DTCC. Some of these members have indicated they will also pursue in-house Ethereum development.
* JPMorgan (http://jpm.com): Despite its membership in at least one blockchain assortium, the bank has said it will build its own Ethereum project in-house.
* Microsoft (http://microsoft.com): Having sponsored the 2016 Ethereum developer conference in Shanghai, it should come as no surprise that Redmond would offer Azure blockchain hosting for Ethereum chains.
